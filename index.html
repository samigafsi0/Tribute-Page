          <h2>The Man Behind the Genius</h2>
          <p>
            Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who
            developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern
            physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for
            its influence on the philosophy of science.

              Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is
              limited, while imagination embraces the entire universe,
              stimulating progress, giving birth to innovation.

            Einstein is best known to the general public for his mass–energy
            equivalence formula E=mc², which has been dubbed "the world's most
            famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for
            his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his
            discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a crucial step in
            the development of quantum theory.
